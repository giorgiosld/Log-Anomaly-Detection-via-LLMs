# Log-Anomaly-Detection-via-LLMs

## Project Overview
This project explores how Large Language Models (LLMs), such as LLAMA or BERT, can be leveraged for anomaly detection in log files. The main goal is to use LLMs to identify patterns and deviations in log data, which could indicate system failures, security breaches, or unusual system behavior. This project is part of the T-725-MALV Natural Language Processing course at Reykjavik University (Fall 2024).

## Motivation
System log files often contain unstructured data, making it difficult to identify anomalies using traditional methods. By using the power of LLMs, we aim to create a more efficient method for analyzing log files and detecting anomalous behaviors that might suggest system malfunctions or security incidents.
